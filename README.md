# BCAProject

## The dataset I chose for this project is provided by NASA and contains data on NEOs (Near Earth Objects). I built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether an NEO is hazardous to Earth.

### This project could be broken up into two halves:

1. The Data Analytics - where I explore different types of plots which will provide different perspectives on the visualization of the data I am using.

2. The Machine Learning parts - where I experiment with different machine learning models and hyperparameters.
